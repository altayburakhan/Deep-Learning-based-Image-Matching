2. Abstract

This project focuses on developing a robust deep learning-based image matching system for visual localization. The system utilizes state-of-the-art neural network architectures to establish accurate correspondences between query images and a database of reference images. By leveraging modern deep learning techniques, we aim to improve upon traditional feature-based matching methods, particularly in challenging scenarios with varying lighting conditions, viewpoints, and seasonal changes. Our methodology combines [specific architecture details] with [specific feature extraction method], trained on [dataset name]. Initial results demonstrate [brief performance metrics], showing promising potential for real-world applications in autonomous navigation and augmented reality.
